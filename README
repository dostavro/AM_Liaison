In order to test AM Liaison run the following commands from the am_liaison/test directory

First of all, start a dummy OMF AM which just creates a topic in the local
XMPP server with its name and prints the received messages
- ruby create_am_topic.rb

Then run the script which tests the AM Liaison with the following order:
1. Creates a new instance of AM Liaison with a database at "/tmp/am_liaison.db"
2. Creates a new OMF AM with urn same as the topic we created above
3. Attachs the OMF AM to the list of the AM Liaison
4. We create 2 tasks in the database of the AM Liaison for execution in 10 and 15 seconds respectively
5. We actually schedule these tasks which results in the creation of two timers
6. We cancel the second task before it fires the event
7. We wait for the first timer to fire the event and send a create message to the dummy OMF AM

- ruby -I ../lib/ -I ../../omf_common/lib/ test_am_liaison.rb
